## Shiny Project

The project must include the following:

1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, .)
2. Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
4. Enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.

## The BMI


- What is BMI? 
- Here is the formula <span class = 'red'>BMI = weight/(height*height)</span>
- weight in kilograms
- height in meters
- The Goal of this app is to instantly compute the Body Mass Index of the app user.

---

## How to find the BMI App

The app can be found on the following address:
[BMI_App](http://yohbos.shinyapps.io/project/)

---

## How does the BMI App work?

- The App is pretty simple to use:
1. Enter your height
2. Enter your weight
3. your BMI will be calculated instantly and the shown on the plot

- Depending on where your find yourself on the graph you can then detemine in which category you are in.

## Have a look at the Application

```{r simple-plot, fig.height = 6, fig.align = 'center', message = F, echo =FALSE}
#How the plot is created

bmi<- function (wt, ht){wt/(ht*ht*(10^-3))}

library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)

wt <- seq(50,170, 0.7)
ht <- seq(100,220, 0.7)
df <- expand.grid(x = as.numeric(wt), y = as.numeric(ht))
    df$z <- as.factor(with(df, ifelse(bmi(x,y)<=1.8, "underweighted",
                                      ifelse(bmi(x,y)<=2.5,"normal",
                                             ifelse(bmi(x,y)<=3.0, "overweigthed","obese")))))
    colnames(df) <- c("weight", 'height', "bmi")
    g<-ggplot(df, aes(y=weight,x=height, colour =bmi))
    g + geom_point() +scale_color_brewer(palette="YlOrRd")
```
